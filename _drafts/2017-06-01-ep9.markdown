**Description**

In which we discuss whether or not Westworld has an HR department (spoiler: the consensus is no).  We also discuss the purpose of human resources and some recent real-world HR failures.  Meanwhile, Pat and Joe repeatedly try and trick Chris into revealing too much information while we begin to question if there’s anything our editor actually removes.
