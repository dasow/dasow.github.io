**Description**

In which we explain what the Three Laws are, discuss the difficulties in implementing them in general and in Westworld in particular, all thanks to the help of a special guest.  Meanwhile, Chris calls everyone dicks as our editor continues to show he doesn’t actually cut anything out of these episodes.
