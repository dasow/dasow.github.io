## About
This repo contains and hosts the website for the Dollars and Sense of Westworld podcast. The actual site is hosted through GitHub Pages and can be accessed by navigating to [http://www.dollarsandsenseofwestworld.com](http://www.dollarsandsenseofwestworld.com).

## Run Locally
A lot of this is covered in the main GitHub help guide which can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)

1. Make sure your running Ruby 2.1.0 or higher
   * If not install RVM - `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`. This will take a while as it will setup RVM and install the latest stable version of Ruby.
2. Check to see if you have bundler - `bundle help`
   * If you get an error install bundle via gem - `sudo gem install bundler`
