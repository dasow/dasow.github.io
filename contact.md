Would you like to reach out to us (seriously, why?) and either discuss the show or tell us why we’re wrong (OK, that makes sense) about something?  You can reach us via the following means:

<div>
**E-mail:** contact@dollarsandsenseofwestworld.com<br/>
**Facebook:** https://www.facebook.com/DollarsAndSenseOfWestworld/<br/>
**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/_dasow<br/>
**Landline:** We’re pretty sure nobody has one of these anymore.<br/>
**Mobile Phone:** After receiving threatening messages from Pat regarding his number being listed, this has been removed until further notice.
